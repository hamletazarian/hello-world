# hello-world

Hi All!

Hamlet here... Thanks for reading my hello-world repo. 

I'm a growth hacker.  I love to come up ways to grow products and or businesses, thru constant testing and feedback loops.  I love it when I can use my python, javascript, php skill sets, to figure out ways to combiine different data sources and new channels for scalable growth. 

Nice to meet you and look forward to working with you.
